# Automatic disaggregation in the Routing in Fat Trees (RIFT) protocol

This feature guide will be published in the (hopefully) near future.

It will cover the general principles of aggregation and disaggregation in the RIFT protocol
(independent of the RIFT-Python implementation)

We have submitted a paper to the Internet Protocol Journal (IPJ) whose contents are essentially
the same as this feature guide.  IPJ states that they prefer that any papers that they publish
have not been published elsewhere before.

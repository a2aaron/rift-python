I used brew to install Thrift on MacOS High Sierra (version 10.13.3):

brew install thrift

This downloaded and installed version 0.11.0 of Thrift, which (according to
https://thrift.apache.org/download) is the latest stable version as of 
3-Jul-2018

Generate Python code:

thrift --gen py common.thrift
thrift --gen py encoding.thrift

TODO list:

* Send LIE packets with network control precedence.

* Add IPv6 support
